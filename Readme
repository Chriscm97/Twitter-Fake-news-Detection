Twitter Fake News Detection

The main contribution of this project is support for the idea that machine learning could be useful in a novel way for the task of classifying fake news. With the nature of the Internet as it is, Fake News is easily created and distributed. Fact checking is tedious and time consuming, most of the models present out there have manually labelled each tweet as real or fake news. This is tiresome and inefficient work in the modern world and can take up to long hours to confirm the originality of the news, so automating Fake News detection is critical. Thus, Fake News classifiers should be created. A classifier must be trained on already existing data. The quality and quantity of the data is important. The features extracted from the news articles are numeric features such as word count, entropy, and many such complicated features. To implement this, various NLP and Machine Learning Techniques have to be used. The model is trained using an appropriate dataset and performance evaluation is also done using various performance measures. The Decision Tree classifier gave us the highest accuracy of 99.54% followed by Random Forest classifier with 98.75% and Logistic Regression Classifier with 98.66% accuracy. Decision tree took the most amount of time about 362 secs and Logistic Regression took the least time of about 20 secs. If we take the time into consideration we can say that the LR model is much better considering the tradeoff between the time taken and accuracy.. We feel that more data would be beneficial in ridding the model of any bias based on specific patterns in the source.
